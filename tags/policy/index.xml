&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a reasonable username or your real name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think before you type - If you disagree with someone that is fine but do not use swear words or any racial slurs, light sarcasm is tolerated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structure sentances in a coherent manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jokes are tolerated so long as they are not portrayed in a racist or dark manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When in an arguement offer constructive criticism, don&amp;rsquo;t be ignorant or stupid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t post personal information about any user under any circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;guidelines&#34;&gt;Guidelines&lt;/h3&gt;
