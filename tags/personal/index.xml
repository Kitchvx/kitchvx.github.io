&lt;p&gt;Just over a couple weeks ago I started my first job within the IT Industry. It&amp;rsquo;s giving me great work experince in using the different &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; tools such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://elementor.com/&#34;&gt;Elementor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sliderrevolution.com/&#34;&gt;Slider Revolution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://woocommerce.com/&#34;&gt;WooCommerce&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m currently designing and developing a website for a local shop in my town, once the site has gone through the design, staging, optimisation and testing phases I will link it. Designing the product pages, catagories, using photoshop and utilising slider revolution to display the deals that are currently on I am working on adding the different products that the business sells along with optimising &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization&#34;&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt;. When the website has passed the testing period it will go live and I will be tasked with maintaining the website to make sure everything goes smoothly, I will be writting documentation on the webiste for people in the future who are hired to maintain the website as the last person to create a website for the shop didn&amp;rsquo;t provide any information or documentation maaking troubleshooting harder than it needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web design and development is fun and helps me show my skills however I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself having a career in it but I do see myself potentially doing freelance for small business and individuals that need a website, like my friend who I am currently creating a website for, using hugo. I will also be managing this website for him as he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to use the command line or have any tools to do back-end development for a webiste using the hugo framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading my small post about my job, didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to say just decided to write about it a little. you can check out my projects &lt;a href=&#34;https://kitch.blog/projects/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
