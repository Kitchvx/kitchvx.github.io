&lt;p&gt;The Comment Policy is in place under the best interest of the users and the site itself. The policy will detail about what is expected of the users and what is not acceptable, should the policy be broken by any user it will result in a removal of the comment and/or the banning of their account from the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here is what comments should look like:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a reasonable username or your real name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think before you type - If you disagree with someone that is fine but do not use swear words or any racial slurs, light sarcasm is tolerated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structure sentances in a coherent manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jokes are tolerated so long as they are not portrayed in a racist or dark manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When in an arguement offer constructive criticism, don&amp;rsquo;t be ignorant or stupid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t post personal information about any user under any circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;guidelines&#34;&gt;Guidelines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Rights Reserved:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;We reserve the right to edit, delete, move, or mark it as spam. We also reserve the right to block any account that violates this comment policy from commenting.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;em&gt;Links:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;If you include a link within your comment, the comment won&amp;rsquo;t be approved until the link has been verified and thought to be relevent to the discussion.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liability:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;By posting a comment, you agree that your contribution is your own and that you take responsibility for it. You agree to hold Nathan&amp;rsquo;s Blog, Nathan himself and other commenters harmless.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spam:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;em&gt;Privacy:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Do not share private information within your comment. We will delete phone numbers, personal email addresses &lt;em&gt;(Work or buisness emails must be specified)&lt;/em&gt;, or any other private or personal information to protect the affected party, however, your own social media accounts such as twitter will be allowed to be exchanged.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
